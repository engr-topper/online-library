    <h1>PRIVACY NOTICE</h1>

    <div id="accordion" style="width: 85%; margin: 0 auto;">
        <h3>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>We collect information about you in three ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>directly from you,</li>
                <li>from automatically collected network logs, and</li>
                <li>through cookies.</li>
            </ul>
 
            <p>We typically keep information only for so long as it is needed for the proper operation of the Library and in order to deliver better Library services to you. We may retain some information in backup storage systems, hard copy form, or as required by law. We collect different types of information from you depending on how you choose to engage with our Library services and the information needed in order to provide you with access to those services. We only collect the minimum we need to deliver the service you are using at the time and we do our best to remove it at the earliest possible opportunity</p>
    
        </div>
        <h3>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Depending on the specific Library services you choose to use, the following are some examples of the ways we use your information in order to provide those services to you.
            <p>We use:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Residency verification for Library cards.</li>
            <li>Personal information for Library records - such as book borrowing details, help desk and reference queries, fine/fee payments, surveys, and promotional and fundraising campaigns.</li>
            <li>Login Credentials, Shared Content and Cookies for delivery of enhanced or personalised services.</li>
            <li>When you sign up for a digital library card through your mobile device, we verify that you are in our service area by checking the geo-location of your device. We do not store or keep this data.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>3. YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            With your consent, you agree to let us use your email address and/or phone number and postal address to communicate with you about our programs, services, and fundraising efforts. However, in accordance with law (Section 4509) and our own commitment to your privacy, information about materials that you check out and information that you access is kept confidential.
          </p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time and we will notify you by posting such changes on our website, so we encourage you to check back periodically for updates. We will alert you to material changes that have been made by indicating on the policy the date it was last updated, by placing a notice on our website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
          </p>
          <p>Privacy is essential to the exercise of free speech, free thought, and free association. The Silent Library (“SL” or “Library”) is committed to protecting your privacy, whether you are a patron, visitor, and/or donor. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect from you and why.
          </p>
          <p>By using our website, attending our events, participating in our programs, downloading our mobile applications, accessing our databases, visiting a Library location, or donating to us, you agree to this policy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>4. LEGAL REQUESTS</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Sometimes the law requires us to share your information, such as if we receive a valid subpoena, warrant, or court order. On such occasions, we will share your information if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our careful review leads us to believe that the subpoena, warrant, or court order is valid, and that the law, including state privacy law applicable to Library records, requires us to do so.
              OR
              </li>
              <li>The Library is the complainant.
                OR
                </li>
                <li>
                  Exigent circumstances exist (for example, a life-and-death emergency or the risk of serious physical injury)
                </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As explained earlier above, we are bound by Law Section 4509, which specifically protects library patron data.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Silent Library receives a valid subpoena, warrant, or court order for a patron’s information, it is our policy to notify the patron via email before any information is disclosed, with certain exceptions such as being required by authorities not to contact the patron, or if we have no way to contact the patron.
